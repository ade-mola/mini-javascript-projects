# Credit Card Checker

## Project Goal
A company suspects that credit card distributors have been mailing out cards that have invalid numbers. In this project, we check if credit cards are valid. Every other clerk currently checks using pencil and paper, but weâ€™ll be optimizing the verification process using knowledge of functions and loops to handle multiple credit cards at a time. Unlike the other clerks, we can spend the rest of our time relaxing!
